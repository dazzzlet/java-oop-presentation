### Polymorphism - The next level of Abstraction

- The word itself indicates the meaning as **poly** means *many* and **morphism** means *types*.

- Polymorphism is a property through which any message can be sent to objects of multiple classes, and every object has the tendency to respond in an appropriate way depending on the class properties.

- This means that polymorphism is the method in an OOP language that does different things depending on the class of the object which calls it.
