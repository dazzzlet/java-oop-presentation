<WhiteLayout title={"Summary"}>

- The goal of software design is to write the code that:
  - meet the customer needs.
  - cost-effectively change by developer.

- The OOP is the guidance to design a robust application.

- The Abstraction is the foundation to build other OOP principles.

- The OOP is not just about design the domain objects.

- Practice OOP from fresher level will build up the system thinking.

- Apply OOP will make the project more complex and cost the runtime resources.
